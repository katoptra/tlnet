# Security

## What this mirror guarantees

Every daily run verifies what it publishes, batch by batch, before publishing it:

- `texlive.tlpdb`, the three installers and the two `update-tlmgr-latest` updaters are
  checked against their SHA-512 and GPG signatures, with the TeX Live primary key
  fingerprint pinned in `Taskfile.yml`. A signature from an expired or revoked key is
  rejected.
- `texlive.tlpdb.xz`, the copy `tlmgr` downloads, must decompress to the verified
  `texlive.tlpdb` byte for byte.
- Every package container is checked against the `containerchecksum` recorded in the
  signed tlpdb.
- A tree that fails any check is never published; the previous good copy stays live.

Those are the only files TeX Live signs. The rest of the tree (`install-tl`,
`install-tl-windows.bat`, `texlive.tlpdb.md5` and the helper trees under `tlpkg/`) is
copied as-is; no TeX Live tool fetches them from a repository URL.

`tlmgr` repeats the signature check on the client, so a tampered mirror is rejected there
too. After each publish, `texlive.tlpdb.sha512` is read back through the domain and compared
with what was uploaded.

Uploads are not atomic. Containers land first and the tlpdb that names them a minute or so
later, and containers are overwritten in place, so a `tlmgr` run that overlaps the publish
can see checksum errors. Rerun it.

## Reporting

If you find a way to serve altered or unsigned content through `tlnet.katoptra.org`, or a
weakness in the pipeline itself, report it privately through
[GitHub's vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/katoptra/tlnet/security/advisories/new).
Please do not open a public issue for it.

Problems with the packages themselves (a malicious or broken upstream package) belong to
[TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) and [CTAN](https://ctan.org/); this mirror copies
what they publish, byte for byte.

## Supported versions

Only the current `main` branch and the live mirror. There are no releases.
